This is hard, but you ofc can do that. Guide by kando, alexmush and me

how to add a brand new level to famidash's array:

1. export the level to csv from Tiled into LEVEL DATA/lvlset_B
2. add level into metadata/lvlset_B_metadata.json5
3. export levels and build, select level set B when prompted
4. launch FD B-Sides

Also keep in mind a rom can only have limited amount of levels
